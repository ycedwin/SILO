# SILO
SILO Climate Data Visualisation Web Application

In this project, Team Panda Hack X will develop a web application for the Queensland Department of Science, Information Technology, and Innovation (DSITI).  The web application will provide data visualization, data aggregation and data download function of SILO climate database. The SILO climate database contains a range of climate variables such as temperature, rainfall, and humidity of Australia daily weather.

In the past, the obtained data from all the stations are written in text form. Therefore, the analysis process is time-consuming and requires extra knowledge for casual users to understand and analyse. With the assist of the web application, the average value of temperature, rainfall and humidity will be calculated and the datasets can be displayed as a graph. The user can simply enter the inputs of start and end dates from 1988 to today and the particular station to obtain the specific and customizable graphs. The SILO web interface will then show the minimum, maximum, or average temperature, rainfall and humidity of the datasets. It also allows users to create graphs of weekly, monthly and yearly values for different measurements.

Also, users can download the dataset in CSV format and the customizable graph as the PNG image. Finally, users can compare and investigate the data by themselves. With the data visualization and data aggregation, this web application will provide a user-friendly interface and valuable statistics information of the historical Australian climate data.
